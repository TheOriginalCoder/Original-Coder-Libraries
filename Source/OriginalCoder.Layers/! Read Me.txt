Original-Coder-Libraries
Libraries for .NET that provide a wide selection of features and capabilities.

Please check out my profressional blog at https://www.originalcoder.dev

I've been building reusable libraries and freameworks since the 1990s. Since starting work in C# about 14 years ago 
I've built up a rather massive collection of libraries that I've started the process of converting into open source. 
This project will be where the open source versions of those libraries reside.

Now now this should be considered an Alpha release. I'm mostly uploading at this point to get the repository 
estabulished and to start figuring out the best way to manage this and have binaries posted on NuGet.

Much of the code I'll be including in the iniital alpha release is based on very clean and well documented library 
code I've been using for years. But I've done a bit of refactoring and cleaning up in addition to modernizing the 
code. A lot of the original code was written some years ago and didn't take advantage of newer C# features. I have 
not yet transferred or written unit tests so I'm not certain everything works at the moment. But it is good, high 
quality code so you're welcome to give it a try and if you find any bugs either let me know of submit a fix.
